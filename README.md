# ssb-group-admin-spec
_working title_

## Problem

Some groups want to be able to define "Admins" who have special permissions.

Some of these permissions might be through group agreement, some might be through the existence of a special "sub-group" for admins (which has access to P.O. Box keys for example)

Stories about how having admins plays out, or doesn't




## Questions

1. Does this use the `ssb-permisions-spec` ?
    - check that spec for questions!
2. Can people take actions "against" the admins?
    - e.g. invite someone to the group, change a group setting?
    - a) if they can what happens?
        - i) is the action ignored by reducing logic
        - ii) does it go ahead but the group is notified?
